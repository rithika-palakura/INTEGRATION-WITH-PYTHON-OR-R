# DESCRIPTION OF TASK
This project highlights the integration of Python with Tableau to perform advanced data analysis and create compelling visualizations. By combining Python's computational capabilities with Tableau's user-friendly visualization tools, I developed an insightful dashboard showcasing key trends and patterns from transactional data. The dataset used for this project was in CSV format and contained details about transactions, such as dates, payment methods, coffee types, and revenue. These data points provided a strong foundation for analyzing customer behavior and financial performance. The first step in the process involved preparing the data. I loaded the CSV file into Python for initial exploration and cleaning. This step ensured the dataset was free of inconsistencies, such as missing or duplicate values, and ready for integration with Tableau. Python's rich libraries for data manipulation, such as Pandas, allowed me to perform calculations like aggregating revenue, categorizing coffee types, and generating new insights. Once the preprocessing was complete, the cleaned data was imported into Tableau to design interactive visualizations. For the visualizations, I began with a line chart to analyze revenue trends over time. By placing the `date` field on the x-axis and the sum of `money` on the y-axis, I created a visualization that highlighted revenue fluctuations and potential seasonal trends. Converting the `date` field to a continuous variable ensured smooth transitions across time periods. This chart provided a clear picture of how revenue varied daily, helping to identify peak performance periods.
Next, I created a bar chart to visualize the popularity of coffee types based on revenue. By placing `coffee_name` on the x-axis and the sum of `money` on the y-axis, I ranked the coffee types in descending order of revenue. This visualization revealed which products were most profitable, offering valuable insights into customer preferences and product performance. Adding labels and color coding enhanced the chart's clarity and visual appeal, making it easy to interpret. The third visualization was a pie chart to represent the distribution of payment methods. Using the `cash_type` field, I categorized the slices of the pie chart and used the count of transactions as the metric for each category. This chart provided an intuitive understanding of customer preferences for payment methods, such as cash versus card transactions. Adjusting the size and adding labels ensured the visualization was both aesthetically pleasing and informative.
These three visualizations were then combined into a comprehensive Tableau dashboard. The dashboard offered an interactive experience, allowing users to filter data by coffee type or date range to explore specific trends in detail. The visualizations complemented each other, providing a holistic view of the data and enabling actionable insights. For instance, users could observe how specific coffee types performed during different time periods or identify shifts in payment method preferences over time.
The final dashboard was exported as a PDF for portability and shared as part of the deliverables. Accompanying the dashboard was a detailed write-up explaining the methodology, tools, and insights derived from the analysis. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate Python with Tableau to perform advanced analytics, create engaging visualizations, and deliver a cohesive and interactive report that effectively communicates meaningful insights.
